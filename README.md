## Project Info
This project is created for the CIS-11 assignment. The code is written in LC-3 and contains some advanced concepts and basic ideas. The purpose of this project is to create a grading calculator that can prompt the user for 5 test scores, validate they're within range, output a letter grade for each score, and output the min, max, and average scores for the user.

## Features
* Input 5 test scores
* Validates the scores within 0-100
* Outputs a letter grade for each one
* Outputs the min, max, and avg scores
  
## Technologies
The program was created using LC-3
* LC3Edit.exe
* Simulate.exe

## Installation/Set Up
1.) Install LC-3

2.) Download the .asm file

3.) Open LC3Edit.exe and assemble

4.) Open simulate.exe and load in the .obj file for the program

5.) Click "Run" under the "Execute" tab

## Usage
How to use the program once it's running:

1.) Enter each of your 5 test scores.

2.) Then, the program will check if they are valid or not.

3.) If they are, it will output a letter grade for each one.

4.) Once all 5 of your scores have been entered, the program automatically outputs the min, max, and average score.

5.) To use the program again, close the console, reload the program, and click "Run" again.

## Documentation
The documentation file goes indeph on how the code is constructed and other information that helps give the user an idea on what the code will be used for and who will be using it.

## How To Edit Code
If you want to make changes to the code, you will need to:

1.) Launch LC3Edit.exe

2.) Open .asm file containing code

3.) Edit code

4.) Assemble code and check for errors

5.) Save if you need to
